# Password Generator

## Purpose
This webpage generates a random password based on the input of the user. The password must be 8 or more character, but less than 129 characters. The user selects the lenght and then selects which characters to use for the password based on the various character options. The character options include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. The password can use all or one of these options, but one option must be selected. Once a valid number is entered and at least one option selected, the site alerts the user of what character options they selected and that a password has been generated. The password is displayed in the text box that holds the password that was randomly generated.
